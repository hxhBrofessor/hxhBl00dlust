## About hxhBl00dlust

`hxhBl00dlust` is a python script that installs all my go-to/favorite haxoring tools to go for the kill/pwnage. Still a work in progress, looking forward to converting this script into other langagues for funsies. In caase you were ever in a sticky situation with no internet, I added `theHacktrick's Wiki` into the script to make it easier to research potential leads. 

### Quick-Notes

- `Feroxbuster` gets compiled in the directory of `hxhBl00dlust`, just move the file to the following path

  - `sudo mv feroxbuster /opt/feroxbuster/feroxbuster`

- `theHarvester` has to be ran within `/opt/theHarvester/` directory for it's dependies... still troubleshooting por que
